consider what you know about me... how can i mkae programming a habit that i enjoy (factor in the code i write for my part time job too) i want to see programming as an enjoyable task again

You’re learning C++, doing research, and coding for your part-time job — that’s a *lot* of cognitive load. Wanting coding to feel joyful again isn’t about discipline; it's about **protecting the spark while still making progress.**

Based on what I know about you — you’re ambitious, multi-project minded, can get overwhelmed by "doing it the *right* way", and care about growth — here’s a plan that aligns with your psychology and goals.

---

## 🌱 **First Principle: Separate “Learning Coding” from “Working Coding”**

Right now your brain pairs programming with:

* deadlines
* correctness
* expectations
* evaluation
* productivity
* being “good enough”

That kills play.

So you need *two modes*:

| Mode          | Purpose                             | Examples                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work code** | deliver, be efficient, professional | job tasks, PhD scripts                            |
| **Play code** | curiosity, exploration, creativity  | C++ toy games, Raylib experiments, silly programs |

> *If every coding session feels like proving yourself, joy leaves the room.*

Your habit isn't "code every day."
It’s **touch play-coding regularly**, even in small doses.

---

## 🎮 **Daily / Weekly Habit Structure**

Aim small. Tiny. Micro-wins.

### **Daily (optional)** — *5–15 min play coding*

* one LearnCpp lesson
* add one feature to a toy project
* render a shape in Raylib
* console mini-game logic (tic-tac-toe, RPG menu)

It should feel like:

> “Ooh, fun, let’s see this work,”
> not
> “Ugh, I need to grind.”

### **Weekly (mandatory)** — *1 “creative coding” session*

~60–120 minutes
Coffee shop or student lounge. Music. Cozy. No pressure.

Rules:
✅ curiosity > productivity
✅ you can quit when it's boring
❌ no academic scripts
❌ no job code
❌ no guilt

---

## ✨ **Rebuild Your Identity as a Creator**

You’re not “learning coding.”

You’re **building worlds.**

You’re making your brain remember:

> *Coding is how I build new stuff.*

Try:

* A journal of little programs you made
* A folder of “coding art”
* Screenshots of console games you build
* A GitHub repo of “Tiny Worlds Experiments”

Progress over performance.

---

## 🧠 **Taming Over-Preparation**

You tend to:

* feel like you must learn all fundamentals first
* fear “not learning properly”
* over-research before coding

Your mantra now:

> **Build first. Learn what breaks. Fix only what's needed.**

That’s how game dev works anyway.

---

## 💡 Motivation Anchors for *You*

You're motivated by:

* storytelling
* creativity
* being proud of your growth
* building something bigger than coursework

So tie coding to those:

| Theme         | Example                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Story         | code text-based adventure systems          |
| Worldbuilding | procedural map generators (fits your PhD!) |
| Aesthetics    | terminal UI styling, ASCII art             |
| Impact        | “one day this becomes a real game piece”   |

Let programming serve your imagination — not the other way around.

## 🎯 Practical Routine Checklist

Try this template:

✅ 3× per week 15–30 min **fun code**
✅ 1 weekly 1–2 hr **creative session**
✅ 1 “log of wins” entry (what you made / learned)
✅ 1 small **share** (GitHub push, screenshot, journal note)

---

## ☕ Ritual Suggestions

Make it a vibe:

* favorite playlist
* cute drink ritual
* specific cozy location
* timer (25 minutes only)
* no Slack/email/Piazza/dev work tabs

Protect the atmosphere, not the outcome.

---

## ❤️ One last thing

Burnout wasn't because you don’t love coding.
It’s because you **cared too much**, tried too hard, and forgot to leave space for play.

You’re rebuilding a relationship with programming — not just a routine.

And you're doing it with intention and maturity.

That’s powerful.

## 🎮 1) Tiny C++ Console Game Projects (Progression Path)

> Goal: *fun, tiny wins, confidence-building, not perfection.*

### ✅ **Level 0 — Warm-up**

Small programs to feel momentum fast.

| Project           | Concept                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Hello menu world  | Input/output, loops    |
| Number echo       | Variables, types       |
| Simple calculator | Functions & arithmetic |
| Countdown timer   | Loops, sleep()         |

---

### ✅ **Level 1 — Game-like Program**

| Project                 | Mechanics                    | Skills                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |

> These align with your PCG research — smooth transition into raylib later.

---

### ✅ Challenge Rule

> **Never write more than 60 minutes without running the code.**

You like depth — this keeps you playful & iterative.

---

## ☕ 2) Cozy Coding Ritual (Markdown Checklist)

> Make coding feel like a treat, not a task.

```markdown
# 🧸 Cozy Coding Ritual

## ✅ Prepare the vibe
- [ ] Warm drink
- [ ] Lo-fi or cozy fantasy playlist
- [ ] Phone on Do Not Disturb
- [ ] Clear desk or blanket + couch setup

## ✅ Set gentle intention
- [ ] “I'm here to explore, not prove.”
- [ ] Pick one tiny goal (15–45 min max)

## ✅ Session structure
- [ ] 10–15 min: warm-up task / debug / play
- [ ] 20–30 min: build something tiny
- [ ] 5 min: admire it / screenshot / git push

## ✅ Closure ritual
- [ ] Write 1 sentence: “Today I made ___”
- [ ] Mark 1 win, even tiny
- [ ] Walk away before tired

✨ Rule: Stop when it’s still fun.
```

You thrive on **agency + kindness** — this protects the joy.

## 🧠 4) Mindset Rewrites (for Your Tendencies)

| Trap Thought                                     | New Pattern                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| “I need to really *learn* this before coding.”   | **I learn fastest by building & breaking.**           |
| “I should know this already.”                    | **I’m leveling up — not racing anyone.**              |
| “This code needs to be clean.”                   | **First draft is discovery, not art.**                |
| “I’m falling behind.”                            | **I'm building *longevity*, not cramming.**           |
| “If I don't master it deeply, what's the point?” | **Depth comes from repetition & use, not pre-study.** |
| “This isn't efficient.”                          | **Play builds passion; passion builds mastery.**      |

Bonus self-talk cue:

> *"Let curiosity drive, not pressure."*

You're not just learning C++ — you're building a **sustainable creative identity**.

Perfect â€” we'll start **minimal and clean**, but structure it so you can smoothly layer in VS Code tasks (**option 2**) and later CMake (**option 3**) without having to reorganize everything.

## âœ… Folder Structure to Support All Three Approaches

```
cpp-learning/
â”œâ”€â”€ lessons/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter01/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hello_world/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ variables/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter02/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ functions/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ control_flow/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/           # for small game/program experiments later
â”œâ”€â”€ build/              # future CMake build directory (empty for now)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### âœ… Why this works

| Folder              | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `lessons/`          | Your LearnCpp exercises, one folder per concept |
| `projects/`         | For when you start game dev experiments         |
| `build/`            | Reserved for CMake builds later                 |
| `.vscode/` (future) | Where VS Code build configs will live later     |

---

## âœ… Initial `.gitignore`

Put this in root:

```
# macOS
.DS_Store

# VS Code settings (weâ€™ll add later when doing option 2)
.vscode/

# build artifacts
*.o
*.out
*.exe
main
/build/

# CMake extras
CMakeFiles/
CMakeCache.txt
cmake_install.cmake
Makefile
```

---

## âœ… First Lesson Boilerplate

`lessons/chapter01/hello_world/main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## âœ… How to Run (Manual â€” Option 1)

From `hello_world`:

```bash
clang++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

Manual for now â€” later we'll automate (option 2 & 3).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap to Using Options 2 & 3 Later

You now have a structure where you can bolt on:

### âœ… Option 2: VS Code build tasks (when ready)

Weâ€™ll add:

```
.vscode/tasks.json
.vscode/launch.json
```

So you can hit **Cmd + Shift + B** to compile and debug.

---

### âœ… Option 3: CMake (later, for real projects)

Weâ€™ll create:

```
projects/my_game/
â””â”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
```

And build into `/build`.

Youâ€™ll learn:

* `cmake`
* linking libraries (SFML, raylib, SDL2 later)
* debugging in VS Code

This puts you on the **professional C++ game dev path**.

---

## ðŸš€ Youâ€™re Set Up & Future-Proofed

You now have:

âœ” Simple structure for learning C++
âœ” Future landing space for VS Code configs
âœ” Future landing space for CMake builds
âœ” Clean repo to grow with you

---

## ðŸ“Ž Want me toâ€¦

Pick one and Iâ€™ll generate it for you:

A) Auto-create this folder tree with placeholder files
B) Provide an initial `README.md` describing your learning plan
C) Provide the VS Code tasks & debug configs but not activate yet
D) Provide a CMake starter file for future SFML / raylib games

Tell me `A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`.
You can pick multiple like `A + B`.
